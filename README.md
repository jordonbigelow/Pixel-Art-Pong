# Name:
- Pong

# Controls:
#### Player 1: 
- W to move the paddle up
- S to move the paddle down
#### Player 2:
- I to move the paddle up
- K to move the paddle down

# Purpose:
- I simply wanted to practice my game dev skills by redoing an old classic. One of the first video games of all time.
- This helped me focus on the technical side, instead of trying to be a game designer as well.
